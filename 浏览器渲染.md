# Layout vs Reflows

The first time the size and position of nodes are determined is called `layout`. Subsequent recalculations of node size and locations are called `reflows`.

# Paint

> _There are specific properties and elements that instantiate a layer_, including `<video>` and `<canvas>`, and any element which has the CSS properties of `opacity`, a `3D transform`, `will-change`, and a few others.

# Compositing

When sections of the document are drawn in different layers, overlapping each other, compositing is necessary to ensure they are drawn to the screen in the right order and the content is rendered correctly.

**As the page continues to load assets, reflows can happen** (recall our example image that arrived late). _A reflow sparks a repaint and a re-composite._

> Had we defined the size of our image, no reflow would have been necessary, and only the layer that needed to be repainted would be repainted, and composited if necessary. But we didn't include the image size! When the image is obtained from the server, the rendering process goes back to the layout steps and restarts from there.
